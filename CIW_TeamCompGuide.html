            <br><h1>Team Composition or Building Introduction</h1><br>
            <p>Teams are essential when you want to become stronger in the game. 
            <br>This guide will give you an idea on how teams and team building works in the game.<br>
            We will be tackling the main principles and basics about teams.
            <br>Keep mind that some teams are very flexible. 
            The addition of new characters <br>and mechanics can change the rotations and usability of some teams.<br>
            </p>

        
            <br><h1>A Good Team must have the following:</h1></br>
            <p>
                <br>Good rotations<br>
                <br>Good Energy Management<br>
                <br>Good Reactions (Not needed for Mono Element Teams and Physical)<br>
                <br>Good Survivability<br>
            </p>
            
            <br><h1>Rotations</h1>
            <p>
                A good rotation must be able to fulfill each characters role efficiently.
                <br>The rotations can be planned for each character or the rotation can be flexible
                <br>wherein each characters can be swapped freely. Always keep in mind the cooldown of
                <br>each characters skill because they are essential in a proper rotation.
            
       
            <br><h1>Energy</h1>
            <p>
                A good rotation must have good energy management. Energy is what characters use<br>
                in order to cast their elemental bursts. The Shimenawa's Reminiscence artifact set 
                also <br>uses energy in order to utilize the 4-piece set. A DPS should have some 
                energy recharge but should<br> not focus on energy recharge as its main stat (excluding Raiden Shogun).
                A support needs a good amount<br> of energy recharge because they need their elemental bursts
                to be usable when they are used in a rotation.<br> Some characters can act as a "battery" in order 
                to give their team members or damage dealers <br>energy particles by switching to the character that needs
                energy while the energy particles <br>are going to the character. in order to cast their burst.
        
            <br><h1>Reactions</h1>
            <p>
                Reactions work when an element is applied and an element triggers the element
                applied.<br> You can amplify the strength of reactions with elemental mastery. Some reactions 
                either buff, debuff,<br> or does damage in general. The Vaporize reaction which uses hydro and 
                pyro has a multiplier of 1.5x if the pyro<br> element is the trigger and a multiplier of 2x if the hydro element is the trigger.
                The Melt reaction which uses<br> cryo and pyro has a multiplier of 1.5x if the 
                cryo element is the trigger and a multiplier of 2x if the pyro element<br> is the trigger.
                Reactions like Electro-Charged and Overload use the elemental mastery stat in order<br> for their damage.
                Electro-Charged uses hydro and electro while Overload uses pyro and electro.<br><br> These are damage dealing
                reactions that are seperate numbers from the character damage number.<br> These types of reactions are essential
                for some teams that use these reactions for their damage. Superconduct<br> is a reaction between cryo and electro.
                This reaction is to reduce to physical resistance of an enemy.<br> This is used for physical damage dealers.
                Swirl does damage with all elements besides Geo. It uses elemental mastery<br> and scales off your character's level.
                Crystallize creates elemental shields based on the applied element on the enemy.<br> Freeze is a reaction that happens when
                you apply cryo and hydro. Like the name says, you can freeze enemies but you<br> cannot freeze some enemies like bosses.
                Shatter happens when a frozen enemy is hit by a claymore or a heavy hit which<br> causes some damage. This reaction is not
                generally recommended because as of now it is weak.
            </p>

        
            <br><h1>Survivability</h1>
            <p>
                A good team needs to survive on the field of battle. You can either bring a healer or shielder or both.<br> Some characters
                can reduce the damage you take from enemies. They can reduce physical or elemental damage.<br> Some characters have iframes which
                are frames where characters cannot be hurt so learning your<br> character's iframe can be helpful. Some characters also
                have interruption resistance where they still take damage<br> but cannot knock you back. Knowing what characters provide the
                survivability you need can help your team<br> do more damage by not worrying if your character will die. This makes the rotations
                more comfortable.
            </p>

        
            <br><h1>Character Roles</h1>
            <p>
                You must learn the role of the characters you put in a team. You must learn if the character<br> you use is a damage dealer or dps, sub-dps,
                healer, shielder or damage reducer, and buffer.<br> You need to balance these in a team so your team can reach its full potential.
                Some characters<br> fulfill many roles while some fulfill one so learning what your character can do and<br> their strengths and weaknesses can
                create a better team for you to use when you are playing.<br><br><br><br>Now that you have learned the principles of a good team composition.
                You can use the<br> characters you have and try to draw out their full potential in a team you want to make.<br> Don't force yourself to use a character
                you don't like and always remember to have fun<br> in making a team and playing the game.
